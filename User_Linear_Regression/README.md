This project focuses on implementing a Linear Regression algorithm for predicting brain weight based on head size using Python. Here's a brief summary of the project:

- Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform a linear regression analysis on a dataset containing information about head size (in cm^3) and brain weight (in grams). The project aims to establish a linear relationship between these two variables and make predictions using a custom linear regression algorithm.

- Dataset: The dataset, named 'MarvellousHeadBrain.csv', is loaded using Pandas and contains two columns: 'Head Size(cm^3)' and 'Brain Weight(grams)'.

- Linear Regression: The project employs the least squares method to calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line. The equation of the regression line is determined as `y = mx + c`.

- Visualization: The project utilizes Matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the data points and overlay the regression line for visualization.

- Goodness of Fit (R-squared): The code calculates the R-squared value to assess the goodness of fit of the linear regression model. R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.

- Main Function: The main function, when executed, runs the Linear Regression analysis on the dataset and displays the results, including the slope, intercept, and R-squared value.

The project provides a practical demonstration of Linear Regression as a supervised machine learning technique for predicting brain weight based on head size. It showcases data analysis, visualization, and the calculation of the model's goodness of fit, making it a valuable learning resource for those interested in linear regression and data analysis.
